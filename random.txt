To enforce system behavior and to prevent users from ͞ gaming͟ the process, we ensure
that all participants are pseudonymous, that witnesses are assigned randomly, and that
no one can participate in the same game in more than one role.
Triǀe™ has 5 types of ͞ players͟ . Each ͞ player͟ is pseudonanymous wallet with an
attached reputation score, no personally identifying information (pii) is ever collected.
Anonymity must be sacrosanct if we are to preserve the santicity of the Trive™ process.
 Consumers who consume the news and send stories of interest to the
marketplace for Curators to find and research;
 Curators who bid on stories and publish lists of article claims with an incentive
to maximize profit, reduce research costs and deliver quality;
 Researchers who are incentivized to find and document convincing true data
quickly and efficiently, lest their time be spent for nothing and their reward
taken by someone better;
 Verifiers who verify the supporting evidence collected by the Researchers
above, and are rewarded if/when the Researcher͛ s err;
 Witnesses who review research and participate in the truth scoring process,
earning a small fee and enjoying the truth discovery process.
Each of these roles have a set of incentives that maximizes the search for the truth and
minimizes gaming.
